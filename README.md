# Advent of Code 2023
My progress through [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) using Python!

### Complying with Advent of Code copyright
To comply with the copyright of Advent of Code, inputs files (`**/inputs/puzzle.txt`) and PyTest unit tests (which are built on the provided inputs) are not pushed to this repo. To run each day, a valid `puzzle.txt` needs to be created under a `inputs/` folder in the corresponding day folder.
